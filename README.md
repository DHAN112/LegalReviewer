### ## 🎯 The Problem

In today's rapidly evolving job market, professionals and students face significant uncertainty. They struggle to identify the specific skills needed to transition into their desired careers and lack a clear, actionable plan to acquire them. Generic advice is often unhelpful, while personal career coaching is expensive and inaccessible. This leads to wasted time, misdirected effort, and significant career anxiety.

### ## ✨ Our Solution

**Career Compass AI** is a web-based, personalized career and skill advisor that provides a clear and immediate path forward. Our platform leverages the power of a large language model to provide two core features:

1.  **AI-Powered Skill Gap Analysis:** Users input their current skills and desired career goal. Our AI analyzes this to instantly identify the critical skills and knowledge they are missing.
2.  **Personalized Learning Roadmap:** Based on the identified gaps, the platform generates a custom, step-by-step learning roadmap, complete with key topics to master and practical project ideas to build a strong portfolio.

We don't just show you the problem; we generate the solution.
